# toDo

ToDo Project
A simple To-Do List Application is a dynamic and feature-rich web-based task management tool designed to help users efficiently organize their tasks, projects, and to-do lists. This project aims to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for task management, prioritization, and collaboration. It offers a comprehensive set of functionalities, allowing users to create multiple lists, manage tasks within each list, and enhance productivity.

#User Instructions
The site should originally render with no lists and a hidden 'task' box. The hidden task box will render when a list is created and selected. You will then be able to add tasks, delete tasks, mark tasks as complete and clear completed tasks. Users will also be able to delete whole lists as well. When a list is deleted, the tasks box will be hidden again until a different list is selected.

#Developer's thoughts

I used base CSS w/ SCSS to style my list. I went back and forth with using a framework like bootstrap/tailwind but wanted to keep css/scss skills polished. The interface is really simple and kept it that way on purpose to avoid unnecessarily complicating the javascript portion more than necessary.

The JavaScript Portion was very difficult. I found myself relying on outside sources and second guessing myself every step of the way. Since I was second guessing myself, I am aware of missing some requirements such as an option to edit tasks. The MTEC program is great, but I think the JavaScript portion up to this point has not provided enough small practice portions and heavily relies on moving quickly from subject to subject and using large projects to try and solidify the information. This doesn't work with my learning style and I've struggled to find time outside of class where I can spend time going over all the topics. It can also be difficult to find practice challenges relating to the topics covered in class.

By the end of the project I found myself just rushing to finish as my inexperience was making things more confusing than necessary. I believe I had also poorly planned this from the start which added to a lot of feelings of confusion and frustration.

I'm looking forward to moving forward and continuing to practice everything we are learning to continue to solidify and enhance my skills/knowledge. I know a lot of my issues stemmed from inexperience and not knowing how to think and break down a problem. I know this is a common feeling among other beginners and this is something I will be pushing through for some time to come until it starts to become more natural.
